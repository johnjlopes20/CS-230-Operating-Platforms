# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

This project was developed for The Gaming Room, a client seeking to expand their mobile game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based distributed environment. The objective was to create a responsive web application that supports real-time gameplay for multiple players and teams, while prioritizing performance, security, and seamless cross-platform functionality.

In creating the design documentation, I focused on clarity and thoroughness. I documented each aspect of the architecture, requirements, and constraints, ensuring the client’s business and technical needs were met. One strength in the documentation was the structured approach to evaluating operating platforms, which allowed me to provide clear recommendations for Linux, Windows, Mac, and mobile environments. This information is crucial for guiding development and optimizing the game’s performance on different platforms.

Working through the design document before coding helped clarify the requirements and functionality needed, which simplified the development process. This structured planning helped me anticipate challenges, especially around data management and user authentication, and ensured a smooth transition to coding.

If I were to revise one part of the documentation, I would enhance the system architecture section with a detailed visual diagram. A more illustrative representation of the microservices setup would help future developers quickly grasp the system’s distributed nature and component interactions.

Understanding and addressing the user’s needs was integral to my design process. Focusing on security, ease of use, and real-time performance ensures that the game meets users' expectations and provides an enjoyable experience. User-centered design helps build software that is more likely to be adopted and well-received, which is critical for a competitive product like a multiplayer game.

For the design, I approached it with an emphasis on modularity and scalability. In future projects, I plan to incorporate additional early-stage user testing and leverage more visual tools, such as flowcharts and prototypes, to optimize the design and improve clarity for both clients and developers.
